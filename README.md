# StockTracer
Scrapes various investment communities on Reddit for data pertaining to specific stocks and provides a visualization for said data.
This was a team program created during a Hackathon with WICS (Woman in Computer Science)

FinanceGUI.py is the main code. There are a few libraries that will need to be install before the code is able to be ran.

All members of our team have been interested in trading stocks for the last couple of years and we thought it would be exciting to build a program that pertains to our interests. 

We learned about a lot of in-depth techniques when it comes to general data science and data visualization, especially in terms of numpy and pandas. 

We made heavy use of these libraries in Python to create our project.
